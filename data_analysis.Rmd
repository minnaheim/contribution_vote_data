```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

# Set Up

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

```


## Import Data

Importing the cleaned roll call data
```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
